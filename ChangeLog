Release 0.2.3 - 2015-11-11

* If mapreduce.job.user.name is set, executor uses the specified user name to
  submit a MapReduce job or accessing to HDFS. This is applicable only when
  Hadoop is running in non-secure mode. In secure mode, that user name will be
  ignored by HDFS and they use Kerberos instead.


Release 0.2.2 - 2015-10-28

* Remote MapReduce tasks propagate UserDataException. This is useful for
  applications to know whether a task failed because of external factors
  or user input where retrying doesn't help until user fixes the input.
